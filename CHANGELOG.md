# srtd

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- c5bba36: ### New `--bundle` option for `build` command

  - Added a new `--bundle` option to the `build` command to produce a single final migration.
  - Updated the `useTemplateProcessor` hook to handle the `--bundle` option.
  - Updated the `TemplateManager` class to support bundling all templates into a single migration file when the `--bundle` option is used.
  - Updated the `README.md` file to document the new `--bundle` option for the `build` command.
  - Added tests to cover the new `--bundle` option.
  - Ensured the bundled file name doesnâ€™t become too long, but still hints at the templates it contains.
  - Ensured the build log correctly references the bundled files for all template records.
  - Ensured the comments in the final migrations have mentions of the original template it came from.
