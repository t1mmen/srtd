# `srtd` ü™Ñ Supabase Repeatable Template Definitions

Live-reloading SQL templates for [Supabase](https://supabase.com) projects. DX supercharged! üöÄ


`srtd` enhances the [Supabase](https://supabase.com) DX by adding live-reloading SQL templates. The single-source-of-truth template ‚û°Ô∏è migrations system brings sanity to code reviews, and the workflow of iterating on database functions, RLS policies, etc.

Built specifically for projects using the standard [Supabase](https://supabase.com) stack (but probably works alright for other Postgres-based projects, too).

## Why This Exists ü§î

While building [Timely](https://www.timely.com)'s next-generation [Memory Engine](https://www.timely.com/memory-app) on [Supabase](https://supabase.com), we found ourselves facing two major annoyances:

1. Code reviews were painful - function changes showed up as complete rewrites rather than helpful diffs
2. Designing and iterating on database changes locally meant constant friction, like the dance around copy-pasting into SQL console

After over a year of looking-but-not-finding a better way, I paired up with [Claude](https://claude.ai) to eliminate these annoyances. Say hello to `srtd`.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Live Reload**: Changes to your SQL templates instantly update your local database
- **Single Source of Truth**: Templates are the source of all (non-mutable) database objects, making changes _and_ code reviews a breeze
- **Just SQL**: Templates build as standard [Supabase](https://supabase.com) migrations when you're ready to deploy
- **Developer Friendly**: Interactive CLI with visual feedback for all operations

## Requirements

- Node.js v20.x or higher
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) CLI installed and project initialized (with `/supabase` directory)
- Local Postgres instance running (typically via `supabase start`)

## Quick Start üöÄ

First, install `srtd` globally or in your project:

```bash
npm install -g @t1mmen/srtd  # Global installation
# or
npm install --save-dev @t1mmen/srtd  # Project installation
# or
npx @t1mmen/srtd  # Run directly
```

Then set up in your [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project:

```bash
cd your-supabase-project
srtd init
```

Create a template (e.g., `supabase/migrations-templates/my_function.sql`):

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION my_function()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Your function logic here
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Start development mode:

```bash
npx @t1mmen/srtd watch  # Changes auto-apply to local database
```

When ready to deploy:

```bash
npx @t1mmen/srtd build  # Creates timestamped migration file
supabase migrate up  # Apply using Supabase CLI
```

## Commands üéÆ

Running `srtd` without arguments opens an interactive menu:

```
‚ùØ üèóÔ∏è  build - Build Supabase migrations from templates
  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è  apply - Apply migration templates directly to database
  ‚úçÔ∏è  register - Register templates as already built
  üëÄ  watch - Watch templates for changes, apply directly to database
```

Or use these commands directly:

- üèóÔ∏è  `build` - Generate [Supabase](https://supabase.com) migrations from templates
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è  `apply` - Apply templates directly to local database
- ‚úçÔ∏è  `register [file.sql]` - Mark templates as already built (interactive UI if no file specified)
- üëÄ `watch` - Watch templates and apply changes instantly

## Perfect For üéØ

Ideal for [Supabase](https://supabase.com) database objects that need full redefinition:

‚úÖ Functions and stored procedures:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION search_products(query text, category_id uuid DEFAULT NULL)
RETURNS SETOF products AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
    SELECT p.* FROM products p
    LEFT JOIN product_categories pc ON pc.product_id = p.id
    WHERE to_tsvector('english',
      p.name || ' ' ||
      p.description || ' ' ||
      p.tags || ' ' ||
      COALESCE((
        SELECT string_agg(c.name, ' ')
        FROM categories c
        WHERE c.id = ANY(p.category_ids)
      ), '')
    ) @@ plainto_tsquery('english', query)
    AND (category_id IS NULL OR pc.category_id = category_id);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

‚úÖ Row-Level Security (RLS) policies:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "users can view own data"
  ON profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

‚úÖ Roles and permissions:
```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
```

**Not recommended for:**

* ‚ùå Table structures
* ‚ùå Indexes
* ‚ùå Data modifications
* ‚ùå Anything that is not fully re-definable, really.

In these cases, use regular [Supabase](https://supabase.com) migrations.

## The Power of Templates üí™

Here's why templates make your life easier. Consider a PR that adds priority to our notification dispatch function.

With templates, the change is clear and reviewable:

```diff
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION dispatch_notification(
    user_id uuid,
    type text,
    payload jsonb
  ) RETURNS uuid AS $$
  DECLARE
    notification_id uuid;
    user_settings jsonb;
  BEGIN
    -- Get user notification settings
    SELECT settings INTO user_settings
    FROM user_preferences
    WHERE id = user_id;

    -- Create notification record
+   -- Include priority based on notification type
    INSERT INTO notifications (
      id,
      user_id,
      type,
      payload,
+     priority,
      created_at
    ) VALUES (
      gen_random_uuid(),
      dispatch_notification.user_id,
      type,
      payload,
+     COALESCE((SELECT priority FROM notification_types WHERE name = type), 'normal'),
      CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    )
    RETURNING id INTO notification_id;
```

Without templates, the same change appears as a complete new file in your PR.

## Configuration üìù

During initialization, `srtd` creates a `srtd.config.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "wipIndicator": ".wip", // Prevents generation of templates with this extension
  "migrationPrefix": "srtd", // 20211001000000_srtd-my_function.sql
  "filter": "**/*.sql", // Glob pattern for templates
  "banner": "You very likely **DO NOT** want to manually edit this generated file.",
  "footer": "",
  "wrapInTransaction": true, // BEGIN; ... COMMIT;
  "templateDir": "supabase/migrations-templates",
  "migrationDir": "supabase/migrations",
  "buildLog": "supabase/migrations-templates/.buildlog.json",
  "localBuildLog": "supabase/migrations-templates/.buildlog.local.json",
  "pgConnection": "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres"
}
```

## Other Features üîß

### Work in Progress Templates

Add `.wip.sql` extension to templates under development to prevent accidental migration generation:

```bash
my_function.wip.sql  # Won't generate migrations during build
```

### Template State Management

`srtd` maintains two logs:

- `.buildlog.json` - Tracks which templates have been built into migrations (commit this)
- `.buildlog.local.json` - Tracks local database state (add to `.gitignore`)

### Register Existing Objects

Import existing database objects into the template system:

```bash
srtd register my_function.sql  # Won't generate new migration until changed
# or
srtd register  # Opens interactive UI for selecting multiple templates
```
